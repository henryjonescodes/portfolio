Determined to compete despite our lack of previous experience, we set our sights on the championship, oiled our bearings, tightened loose bolts, and debugged code. ^Powered by generous donation from Boston's Koa Labs we packed up and shipped out across the U.S. to test our skills. Although we weren't able to secure the world champion title, the atmosphere surrounding the competition was palpable.
