    blurb: "During my final year at Union College, I conducted my senior research study in user interfaces (UI) as a capstone project for my B.S. in computer science. My research aimed to investigate how people respond to unreliable assistive software agents as their ability to effectively anticipate user needs varies. ^The experiment explored how functional trust relationships are built and broken by presenting study subjects with a choice between two suggestions made by a pair of simulated software agents in a match-3 game setting. The game environment was custom-built using Java and the Sting UI library to ensure consistency across all experiment sessions. Every turn each agent would highlight a valid swap on the board, representing a suggestion of varying value. Value was simply the point value in-game of each suggested swap, allowing the agents to suggest actions that were measurably varied in quality. ^In order to simulate the effects of varying agent reliability, each subject was required to choose one of the two offered suggestions at each turn across 5 set scenarios. Their choices were logged and analyzed to investigate how the agent’s suggestions on previous turns affected the subject’s future agent choice. I was particularly interested in whether subjects would choose a lower value suggestion from an agent that previously offered higher value suggestions during previous turns relative to the opposing agent. ^Evidence of functional trust relationships and their effects on gameplay were observed after implementing the experiment with a group of 12 study subjects, results are conjectural due to the small sample size, but point towards the existence of certain conditions that may induce trust relationships between participants and computerized agents in a replicable manner.",

Those weeks, paired with an already acute interest in tech, provided a reference point for the type of work the field offers. The teamwork, atmosphere, and community they've cultivated at Tumblr became a core motivator as I realized my desire to be part of building the complex digital landscape that enables our quality of life in modern society. ^As a high school student with minimal production-ready skills, I wasn’t given any mission-critical tasks. Nevertheless, I was able to dip my toes into Ruby, HTML, and CSS under the watchful supervision of professionals and see firsthand that a career in tech is for me.",

      blurb: "The PHS robotics team was founded in 2013 following a generous donation of equipment from Bank of America. During our first season, while competing in the Maine State Championship we qualified for the VEX Robotics World Championship in Los Angeles. Determined to compete despite our lack of previous experience, we set our sights on the championship, oiled our bearings, tightened loose bolts, and debugged code. ^Enabled by a generous donation from Boston's Koa Labs we packed up and shipped out across the U.S. to test our skills. Although we didn't secure the world champion title, the atmosphere surrounding the competition was inspiring. My peers' and competitors' dedication and excitement showed me that tech is much more than long nights and frustrating problems. It’s that too, but more importantly, it’s the exhilaration of watching countless hours come together in concert to accomplish seemingly impossible tasks and lifting my fellow creators up to make something bigger and more wonderful than any one of us could do alone.",
