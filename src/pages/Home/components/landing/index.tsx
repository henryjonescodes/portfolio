          <p>
            My journey into creative development began with a passion for poster
            and screenprinting design, which quickly evolved into a love for
            coding and web development in my teens. Since then, Iâ€™ve had the
            opportunity to build dynamic, customer-facing UIs for dynamic
            startups in Silicon Valley hard at work building an accessible
            future for human-AI interaction.

            Currently, I focus on creating accessible and intuitive user
            interfaces, thriving in the intersection of design and engineering.
            I enjoy crafting software that not only looks good but performs
            seamlessly. In my free time, I delve into personal projects
            involving Three.js and React, exploring the creative potentials of
            web development.

            When I'm not coding, you'll find me rock climbing, reading, or
            exploring the latest tech trends.
