      <h2>Shaping human-oriented digital experiences</h2>
      <p>
        I make user interfaces with human needs at the forefront, using novel
        tools to craft intuitive and exciting experiences. My passion for UX,
        kickstarted by a print-making hobby and a deep appreciation for
        efficient communication through design, has led me to Palo Alto, where
        Iâ€™m currently helping to shape the future of human-AI communication at
        Channel.ai
