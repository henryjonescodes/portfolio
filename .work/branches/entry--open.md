title: One open morph, the carousel's, at every width

motivation: The phone morph is the reference; every open should feel like it.

## Goal

Opening any entry mounts the window over its source in the closed layout and opens it to a target box the CSS decides (full height on phones, a centred window with a desktop margin on wide screens), with the carousel's per-part clocks (title, date, media, details). Closing morphs back and unmounts on completion. The carousel's own overlay code goes.

## Todo

- [ ] Closed and open layouts keep the same elements in the same order, with shared layoutIds
- [ ] Per-part timings from the carousel tunables, shared by every width
- [ ] Remove EntryCarousel and EntryCard; one provider opens everything
- [ ] e2e: open and close at both widths, and a resize while open
- [ ] The 'content never ahead of the window' check fails on the CI runner only (6 to 10px overhang) since #84; passes locally even CPU-throttled. Re-check once the morph is rebuilt
- [ ] Re-enable the CI skip on the open-sync check in e2e/modal.spec.ts
